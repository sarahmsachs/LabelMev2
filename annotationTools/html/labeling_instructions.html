                        <p>When you enter the tool, an image from our database will be randomly
                        selected and shown. You can help by annotating the aspect of the image
                        that you think indicates when the photo was taken.
                        Once you have completed the image, you can view a new image
                        by pressing the &quot;show next image&quot; button.</p>
                        
                        <p>The following steps describe how to label an object:</p>
                        
                        <p>
                        1. Start by pressing the left
                        mouse button at some point along the boundary of the object.
                        <br />2. Continue clicking along the boundary of the object
                        to create a polygon.
                        <br />3. Once you have finished
                        clicking along the boundary of the object, either click on
                        the first point or press the right mouse button to complete
                        the polygon.
                        <br />4. A window will now appear asking for the object's
                        name, the decade it was taken, and other qualities.  Enter the object's name and provide any additional information you can and click the "Done" button.

                        <p>Use common English words. Try to avoid application specific
                        terms. For instance, avoid doing things such as replacing <em>right arm</em> by <em>ra</em>. This might be useful in the short term but will make difficult reusing the data for other applications in the future. Also, it is always good practice to have data that is itself explanatory.</p>
                        <p><strong>Object naming: </strong>Use common English names for objects.
                        Use a name that you think other people are likely to use to describe
                        the same object. You can use several words to describe an
                        object.
                        Example object names: hair, smile, posture, etc.	  </p>
                        <p><strong>Decade: </strong>Check the corresponding box to indicate in which decade you think the photo was taken. A photo taken in 1987 would be &quot;1980s&quot; while a photo taken in 1990 would be &quot;1990s&quot;.</p>
                        <p><strong>Quality: </strong>Check the corresponding box to report if the quality of the photograph
                            indicated when it was taken. For example, the resolution of the photograph might have helped you decide which year it was taken.</p>

                        <p>The following are some recomendations for how to provide annotations
                        that are as useful as possible. </p>
                        <p><strong>View the entire image: </strong> Make sure that
                        your browser occupies the entire screen and that you scroll
                        to see the entire image.  If you label an object on the edge
                        of your browser, make sure to scroll so that the entire
                        object is visible.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Follow the object outline: </strong> Click on top of the object 
                        boundary so that the polygon accurately delineates the object outline. 
                        The ideal outline should be good enough for somebody to recognize the 
                        object just by seeing the drawn polygon.</p>
                        <p><strong>Labeling occluded objects: </strong>Sometimes objects will 
                        be only partially visible. This is especially true for regions like hair,
                        shoulders, etc
                        which become difficult to label when there are many occlusions. 
                        We recommend in these cases to complete the boundary as if they were not 
                        occluded. </p>
